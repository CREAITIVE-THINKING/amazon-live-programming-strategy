# Amazon Live Programming Strategy Analysis

A data-driven approach to optimizing creator performance, category programming, and audience engagement for Amazon Live streaming.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a data-driven methodology for developing effective programming strategies for Amazon Live. Currently, the main branch uses synthetic data to showcase the analytical approach and strategy generation process.

### ðŸŒ¿ Real-World Data Integration (Feature Branch)

**Interested in Real-World Data?**
- Check out the `feature/use-real-datasets` branch
- Experimental integration of:
  - Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset (Olist)
  - Summer Products Dataset
  - YouTube Engagement Data
- *Status*: Ongoing research and data transformation

> **Note**: The `feature/use-real-datasets` branch is an active exploration of how real-world datasets could be leveraged for more precise insights. Expect ongoing development and potential methodology adjustments.

## Sample Visualizations

Our synthetic data generation creates insightful visualizations that demonstrate the potential of data-driven strategy development:

## Strategy Generation Process

The programming strategy document is automatically generated through:
1. Data Processing: Generating structured insights
2. Pivot Table Generation: Transforming data into multi-dimensional analyses
3. Recommendation Extraction: Identifying key patterns algorithmically
4. Strategy Document Creation: Compiling comprehensive programming recommendations

## Project Structure
- `sql_queries/`: SQL scripts for data transformation and analysis
- `src/`: Python scripts for data processing and strategy generation
- `analysis/`: Output files including pivot tables and strategy documents
- `visualizations/`: Generated charts and graphs

## Key Features
- Data-Driven Decision Making
- Cross-Category Optimization
- Creator Tier Strategies
- Time Slot Optimization
- Engagement-Conversion Correlation

## Visualization Methodology

These visualizations are generated programmatically to:
- Simulate real-world content performance
