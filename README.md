# Amazon Live Programming Strategy Analysis

A data-driven approach to optimizing creator performance, category programming, and audience engagement for Amazon Live streaming.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how data analysis, SQL querying, and pivot table techniques can be used to develop effective programming strategies for Amazon Live. By analyzing e-commerce transactions, product performance, and content engagement metrics, this project showcases the skills required for a Programming Strategy Manager role.

## Datasets

This analysis uses a combination of datasets to simulate the Amazon Live ecosystem:

1. **Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset (Olist)**: Contains comprehensive e-commerce transaction data including products, categories, customer behavior, and sales performance.

2. **Summer Products Dataset**: Provides detailed metrics on product features, ratings, and sales performance that can be used to analyze product appeal.

3. **YouTube Engagement Data**: Contains metrics that can be adapted to simulate creator performance and viewer engagement patterns.

## Analysis Components

### 1. Creator Performance Analysis
- SQL queries to identify high-performing product categories (as proxy for creators)
- Pivot table analysis of "creator" performance by time slot and category
- Recommendations for optimal creator-category pairings

### 2. Time Slot Optimization
- Analysis of peak transaction times to determine optimal programming slots
- Conversion rate analysis by time of day and day of week
- Programming calendar recommendations based on historical performance

### 3. Category Performance Analysis
- Identification of high-converting product categories
- Seasonal trends and category performance patterns
- Strategic programming recommendations by category

### 4. Audience Engagement Patterns
- Purchase behavior analysis to simulate viewer engagement
- Repeat customer analysis as a proxy for viewer retention
- Strategies to optimize engagement and conversion
